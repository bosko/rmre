= Rails Models Reverse Engineering

Rmre is utility gem for creating Ruby on Rails, at the moment only ActiveRecord, models
for legacy databases. Besides creating all models it sets proper table name and primary
key if tables and columns naming doesn't follow Rails convention. It also tries to read
all foreign keys data from a database if DBE is MySql, PostgreSQL, Oracle or MS SQL and
sets models relationships on a basic level through belongs_to and has_many declarations.

= Installation

Rmre gem is on the Rubygems and you can install it with

  gem install rmre

= How to use

Rmre is very simple to use:

  rmre -a mysql2 -d my_database -u my_username -p my_password -o /path/where/models/will/be/created

That's all! Of course there is standard help which you can print at any time:

  rmre --help

or

  rmre -h

I believe that command line options are self explanatory especially if you are familliar
with Ruby on Rails database handling. Apart from Ruby on Rails related options there are
several that should be explained.

== MS SQL options

Options:

  -m or --mode
  -n or --dsn

are user for setting ODBC specific arguments. First one must be used with MS SQL and must
be set to ODBC and the second one is data source name.

== General options

Otput directory can be set with:

  -o /path/to/target/directory
  --out /path/to/target/directory

otherwise Rmre will create models in the directory where it is started.

Rmre can also filter tables for which it will create models. Filtering is very basic and
it mathes whether name of the table starts with passed patterns:

  -i ec_,vi_
  --include ic_,vi_

with create models only for tables names with prefixes ec_ or vi_.

== Test databases

If you want to try *Rmre* and you do not have sample database you can use
_Sakila_ at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila.html#sakila-installation for MySQL and
_Pagila_ at http://pgfoundry.org/projects/dbsamples for PostgreSQL.

= TODO

* Improve filtering
* Write more tests
* Foreign key support for other DBEs (firebird, SQLite, Sybase,...)
* Probably much more which I cannot remember right now
